Baby's got a lot of baggage
It don't seem to matter, it don't seem to matter

Bought a ticket to the mid-west, just for business
But dismissed it from the interest
It was a risk just for a mistress
Who was a hostess on the West Coast

Don't you see it in my eyes tonight?
Baby's got a lot of baggage

Where do I have to go to find a honey with a little soul?
Tokyo, Tokyo
Turn off the lights and let it go
Oh, it's nice to meet you
Kimi tanoshimu
Tokyo, Tokyo
Pay in the palms of the rock 'n' roll

Get that dynamite
Chicka-Boom on the down tonight
I never seem to get it right
But you can show me so politely

Now, don't you see it in my eyes tonight?
Get that dynamite

Where do I have to go to find a honey with a little soul?
Tokyo, Tokyo
Turn off the lights and let it go
Oh, it's nice to meet you
Kimi tanoshimu
Tokyo, Tokyo
Pay in the palms of the rock 'n' roll

Hey, I come back to where you are
Hey, I come back to where you are
Get that dynamite

Where do I have to go to find a honey with a little soul?
Tokyo, Tokyo
Turn off the lights and let it go
Oh, it's nice to meet you
Kimi tanoshimu
Tokyo, Tokyo
Pay in the palms of the rock 'n' roll

Where do I have to go to find a honey with a little soul?
Tokyo, Tokyo
Turn off the lights and let it go
Oh, it's nice to meet you
Kimi tanoshimu
Tokyo, Tokyo
Pay in the palms of the rock 'n' roll

Hey, I come back to where you are
Hey, I come back to where you are

Tokyo
