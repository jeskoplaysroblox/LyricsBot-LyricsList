In My Head
Song by

Kailee Morgue, Mike Shinoda

(In my head)

Let it begin
Push it away, but it's pulling me in
Try to pretend
I'm not aware when I do it again
I know the signs
I see the pattern in front of my eyes
Something inside me opening wide
Stretching and coming alive

I can't stop it when it starts
Trying not to fall apart
Building up until it all goes dark

(In my head) I can feel it getting closer
(In my head) breathing heavy on my shoulder
And I'm trying to fake it
But there's no way to escape it

(In my head) buried underneath the noises
(In my head) there's a million little voices
Saying, "You'll never make it
And there's no way to escape it"
(In my head)

Coming around
Thoughts are intruding, I'm pushing them down
Stopping it now
Blocking out fact, I'm blocking it out
Holding too tight
Kidding myself, turning wrong into right
Thief in the night
I've been the one putting gas in the lights

I can't stop it when it starts
Trying not to fall apart
Building up until it all goes dark

(In my head) I can feel it getting closer
(In my head) breathing heavy on my shoulder
And I'm trying to fake it
But there's no way to escape it

'Cause I'm swirling in the panic of a shaking confidence
No, I don't have an answer when the questions don't make sense

(In my head) I can feel it getting closer
(In my head) breathing heavy on my shoulder
And I'm trying to fake it
But there's no way to escape it

(In my head) buried underneath the noises
(In my head) there's a million little voices
Saying, "You'll never make it
And there's no way to escape it"
In my head
