Architect
Song by

Livingston

Every word you said runs around inside my head again
Every conversation with myself, my God, a therapist
No, you can't resist, you're the name of my apocalypse
Thank the Lord, I didn't fall for it

But something inside of me wants to change the earth
Build my kingdom, watch it burn
Chase a feeling, lift the curse
Teachers told me I'd never learn
I won't be the last, but you won't be the first
Hit when I'm kneeling, do your worst

'Cause I'll take all your sticks and stones
Turn 'em into miracles
Let me let you know, oh-ooh, oh-ooh, oh
I'm never gonna want your pity
Oh, no, no, look at you so cynical
But if I let it go, oh-ooh, oh-ooh, oh
Who else is gonna build this city?

'Cause we are who we say we are
And that's just fine
'Cause I was never gonna take them with me

Sticks and stones
Turn 'em into miracles
Let me let you know, oh-ooh, oh-ooh, oh
Nobody else is gonna build my city

Drag me through the dark, be the villain in my narrative
Dance upon my scars, how I truly love your arrogance
Future felt far 'til you opened up the door for it
Oh, you opened up the door for it

But something inside of me wants to change the earth
Build my kingdom, watch it burn
Chase a feeling, lift the curse
Teachers told me I'd never learn
I won't be the last, but you won't be the first
Hit when I'm kneeling, do your worst

'Cause I'll take all your sticks and stones
Turn 'em into miracles
Let me let you know, oh-ooh, oh-ooh, oh
I'm never gonna want your pity
Oh, no, no, look at you so cynical
But if I let it go, oh-ooh, oh-ooh, oh
Who else is gonna build this city?

Nothing is left, I'm letting you in
Take what you want, take my lies, and my sin
Knew you were staying, so I built a city
Where all my shadows and demons can live

Nothing is left, I'm letting you in
Take what you want, take my lies, and my sin
Knew you were staying, so I built a city
Where all my shadows and demons can live

Sticks and stones
Turn 'em into miracles
Let me let you know, oh-ooh, oh-ooh, oh
Nobody else is gonna build my city

(Oh, oh)
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)

Sticks and stones
Turn 'em into miracles
Let me let you know, oh-ooh, oh-ooh, oh
